### Exercise 5: Loop
Prompt the user to enter a number. Prompt the user to enter another number. Create a for loop that counts from the first number to the second number.

### Exercise 6: Loop
Create a hardcoded/fixed password. Create a loop that will ask the user to enter a password until it matches the hardcoded password. Once they match alert the user `THAT’S CORRECT!!!` Keep asking the user until they get the right password.

NOTE: Your code should handle the password regardless of the case (upper or lower).
### Exercise 6: Repeating timer
Create a button with the text `Start Countdown!`. When the User clicks the button, display a countdown sequence in the browser as an `<h2>` from 10 to `LIFTOFF!!`. Display each number during the countdown each second (1000 ms), leading up to the word `LIFTOFF!!!`. Be sure to stop the timer once liftoff achieved.
